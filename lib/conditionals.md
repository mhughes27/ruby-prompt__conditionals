# What is a conditional?

Conditionals are used to control flow within a program, I think of it like a flow chart.  
If there are two braches you use if and else.  
If there are more than two branches you can use if, elsif, and else using as many eslifs that are needed.  
The program starts at the beginning and runs until one of options is true. 

# What is the difference between `=` and `==`?

A single equals sign is used to assign a value to a variable.  
A double equals sign is used to test for equlity.
